# input data files required:
#ldmip4.ped: pedigree-file (3 columns: ID sireID damID) sorted from old to young IDs are consecutive: 1,2,3,4...
Note: unknown sire dam = 0 or -IDgroup (IDgroup is genetic group number)
Note2: sire and dam are either both unknown or both known


#ldmip4.mrk: SNP genotype files (allele-codes => 1 or 2; missing 0)
#2 lines per genotyped animal:
ID SNP1 SNP2 SNP3....  (where SNP3 = paternal allele-code at locus 3)
ID SNP1 SNP2 SNP3....  (where SNP3 = maternal allele-code at locus 3)
Note: no need to phase the genotypes nor sort them paternal/maternal

#NOTEX:
1. Gla matrix contains genotyped animals, their descendents & parents (ie. not all animals)
2. computertime/memory will be saved by omitting ungenotyped descendants of genotyped animals (unless some of their descendants are genotyped). The relationships of these omitted descendants can be added afterwards by the usual tabular rules (or to the GLAinverse using Henderson's rules for Ainverse) 
3. more distant ancestors of the genotyped animals will have a relationship matrix like in the pedigree A-matrix. Their relationships can also be obtained by single-step methods (Legarra et al. 2009, JDS).
